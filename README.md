# TimeCounter
# A simple time counter. It works only with Windows platforms since functions used there are provided by Windows (QueryPerformanceCounter and QueryFrequencyPerformance). 
# The code itself is in the Counter.cpp source file, and TimeCounter.cpp is a simple demo program.
# Just create an instance of TimeCounter class and call obj.SetCounter() to assess then your code, after that, obj.StopCounter(). 
#At this point, you can retrieve time counted via method getTime().
